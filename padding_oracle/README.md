padding_oracle.py contains the reference implementation. You can try writing and running an attack against a target setup running this reference implementation on boxofhorror.org on port 4321.  You can use padding_oracle_attack.py as a template to start writing your attack.

I'll leave this running for a week after the conference and then post the solution and dockerfile so you can host this challenge yourself.
