## Compression Oracle Lab

compression_oracle.py contains the reference implementation.  You can try writing and running
an attack against a target setup running this reference implementation (with a different flag)
on **boxofhorror.org** on port **1234**.

I'll leave this running for a week after the conference and then post the solution and dockerfile
so you can host this challenge yourself.
